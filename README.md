**Reelix** is an AI-native movie discovery agent that understands your preferred *vibes* and evolving taste, and turns them into cinematic picks just for you.

Under the hood, Reelix is a multi-agent system with four collaborating AI agents that handle intent understanding and planning, candidate curation, next-step guidance, and fit explanations:

- **Orchestrator** — parses queries, builds a structured retrieval plan, and manages multi-turn session memory
- **Curator** — scores candidates on genre/tone/theme/structure fit via parallel LLM evaluation
- **Reflection** — proposes a concrete next-step direction after each recommendation turn
- **Explanation** — streams personalized “why you’ll enjoy it” rationales to the UI

The agents are backed by a **hybrid recommendation pipeline** (dense + sparse retrieval, multi-step reranking) and an evolving **user taste vector** built from interactions and reactions.

---
## Core Experiences

- **Explore by Vibe (`/explore`)**
  Type a vibe — “psychological thrillers with a satirical tone on Netflix” — and get a curated slate with streaming rationales explaining why each pick fits, plus a next-step suggestion to keep exploring.

- **Taste Onboarding (`/taste`)**
  Pick genres and vibes, react to titles (Love / Like / Not for me), and the system builds a taste profile that sharpens every recommendation going forward.

- **For-You Feed (`/discover`)**
  A personalized grid of picks that leans on your taste history. Each card streams a short “Why you might enjoy it” write-up as it loads.

- **Watchlist (`/watchlist`)**
  Save titles, mark as watched, rate 1–10 — every interaction feeds back into your taste profile and future recommendations.

## Architecture - Agentic Workflow and Recommendation Pipeline

At runtime, Reelix is a **four-agent system** (Orchestrator → Curator → Reflection → Explanation) with a sophisticated recommendation engine:

```


### 1) Orchestrator Agent

**Agentic orchestration layer** — *"What should we do next?"*

The orchestrator converts messy natural language into a clean `RecQuerySpec` and keeps it stable across multi-turn refinement.

- **Understands intent from conversation**
  - Interprets the current message in the context of recent turns
  - Decides whether this is a new request, refinement, or a meta/non-rec question

- **Generates fast opening summary**
  - Produces a 2-sentence opening summary (before curator runs) for immediate UI feedback via SSE
  - Summary is based on RecQuerySpec and provides context while recommendations load

- **Builds a small, explicit plan** (`RecQuerySpec` as a "living object")
  - Parse intents into precise query_text, genres, sub-genres, tone, narrative shape
  - Assembles filters (genres, year range, streaming providers, etc.)
  - Decides how much personalization to apply (taste vector, recent interactions)

- **Routes to specialist agents and tools**
  - Calls the **recommendation_tool** (pipeline) with the constructed plan to get candidates
  - The pipeline calls the **Curator Agent** for evaluation and selection
  - Calls the **Explanation Agent** to generate "Why you might enjoy it" rationales for the recommended titles
  - Trigger taste profile updates or logging flows when appropriate

- **Handles multi-turn refinement**
  - Treats follow-ups as **plan edits** rather than isolated queries
  - Preserves `query_id` and session state so downstream tools keep operating over the same evolving context instead of starting from scratch each time


### 2) Recommendation Pipeline (Tool)

**Hybrid retrieval + multi-stage ranking layer** — *"What are the best candidates?"*

This deterministic pipeline executes the `RecQuerySpec` from the orchestrator, retrieves and ranks candidates, then calls the curator agent for final evaluation.

- **Hybrid retrieval (RAG-style)**
  - Calls into Qdrant dense + sparse (BM25) retrieval to build a high-quality candidate set:
    - Dense retrieval over fine-tuned `bge-base-en-v1.5` embeddings
    - Sparse retrieval via BM25 over normalized text
    - RRF / weighted fusion to merge dense + sparse signals

- **Metadata-aware + cross-encoder reranking**
  - Rating, popularity, recency/freshness, genre alignment
  - Diversity / de-dupe to avoid franchise spam and near-duplicates
  - Runs an optional **cross-encoder reranker** on a small window (e.g. top-30), then fuses CE scores back into the final ranking

- **Calls Curator Agent for evaluation**
  - Passes candidates and RecQuerySpec to the curator agent
  - Curator evaluates each candidate on fit dimensions
  - Returns tiered and selected recommendations

- **Fast path to UI**
  - Returns a **ranked slate with metadata** (titles, posters, scores) via SSE immediately so the frontend can render cards and layout **before** why-copy is ready.


### 3) Curator Agent

**LLM-based candidate evaluation layer** — *"How well do these match the vibe?"*

This agent evaluates candidates from the recommendation pipeline using LLM reasoning to score fit across multiple dimensions.

- **Parallel evaluation for reduced latency**
  - Splits candidates into multiple batches
  - Runs parallel LLM calls via `asyncio.gather` to reduce latency
  - Merges results for final selection

- **Multi-dimensional scoring**
  - Evaluates each candidate on 4 dimensions (0-2 scale):
    - `genre_fit`: How well genres/sub-genres match the request
    - `tone_fit`: How well emotional vibe/tone matches
    - `theme_fit`: How well thematic ideas align
    - `structure_fit`: How well narrative structure matches
  - Uses RecQuerySpec and candidate metadata for structured evaluation

- **Tiering and selection**
  - Categorizes candidates as: strong_match, moderate_match, or no_match
  - Applies tier-based selection logic to produce final recommendations
  - Returns curated slate to orchestrator for SSE streaming to UI


### 4) Reflection Agent

**Next-step guidance** — *”Where should we explore next?”*

After each recommendation turn, the Reflection Agent analyzes the curated slate and proposes a concrete next direction to guide continued discovery. It runs before the Explanation Agent for lower latency — the next-step suggestion is fast (single short LLM call) and streams to the UI while the heavier explanation generation follows.

- **Runs post-curator, best-effort**
  - Executes only in RECS mode, after curator evaluations
  - Streams an SSE `next_steps` event with strategy and suggestion text
  - 10-second timeout with graceful degradation — never blocks the main response

- **Four mutually exclusive strategies** (picks one per turn)
  - `more_like_title`: Picks a standout title from results and proposes exploring what makes it special (sub-genre, tone, setting, style)
  - `explore_adjacent`: Identifies a recurring keyword/theme across results and proposes a sideways pivot into a related angle
  - `flip_tone`: The results lean toward one emotional register. Propose the same themes or genre but in a different tone
  - `shift_era`: Detects temporal clustering and proposes a specific different decade

- **Strategy alternation across turns**
  - Persists the chosen strategy as `last_reflection_strategy` in session state (Redis)
  - Ensures diverse suggestions across a multi-turn session rather than defaulting to one strategy

- **Session memory integration for multi-turn flow**
  - Persists suggestion as `last_admin_message` in session state (Redis)
  - On the next turn, the orchestrator recognizes short affirmations (“yes”, “sure”, “let's go”) and auto-advances the suggestion into a new recommendation query
  - Enables fluid, conversational discovery without requiring users to rephrase

- **Full instrumentation**
  - All attempts (success/timeout/error) logged to `reflection_logs` table with strategy, suggestion, latency, token counts, and tier stats
  - Key files: `reflection_agent.py`, `reflection_prompts.py`


### 5) Explanation Agent

**Reasoning & explanation** — *”Why these, and what next?”*

- **Consumes**
  - Ranked slate from the **Recommendation Pipeline** and **Curator Agent**
  - The user's taste profile and recent interactions
  - The current mode (Explore by Vibe vs. For-You)

- **Builds structured prompts to**
  - Generate “**Why you might enjoy it**” copy per title
  - Avoid self-references or hallucinations
  - Produce markdown-friendly output for movie cards

- **Runs in parallel with UI rendering**
  - Kicks off as soon as the slate is available, while the UI is already showing cards and skeletons.

- **Streams results via SSE / JSONL**
  - Incremental `why_delta` events per `media_id` → `done`
  - Inserts the final “why” copy and associated metadata to Redis Supabase for cache and analysis


### 6) Signals, feedback loops & taste updates

The system maintains comprehensive logging across two layers for analysis, debugging, and continuous improvement:

#### Layer 1: Recommendation Pipeline Logging (All Endpoints)
- **`rec_queries`** - Query metadata (query_id, filters, user context, timestamp)
- **`rec_results`** - Per-candidate pipeline scores (dense_score, sparse_score, metadata_score, final_score, rank)

#### Layer 2: Agent Decision Logging (Agent Endpoints Only)
- **`agent_decisions`** - Orchestrator decisions (mode routing, RecQuerySpec generation, LLM usage, latency)
- **`curator_evaluations`** - Per-candidate fit scores (genre_fit, tone_fit, theme_fit, structure_fit, tier, is_served, final_rank)
- **`tier_summaries`** - Aggregate statistics (strong/moderate/no_match counts, selection_rule applied, curator latency)
- **`reflection_logs`** - Reflection agent attempts (strategy, suggestion, status, latency, token counts, tier context)

#### Feedback Loop Integration
- **User interactions** (Love/Like/Dislike, ratings, watchlist actions, trailer views) logged to Supabase
- **Taste vector updates** - Aggregates signals and rebuilds user taste profile
- **Session memory** - Persists query context, RecQuerySpec, and final_recs to Redis for multi-turn conversations
- **"Why" explanations** - Cached in Supabase + Redis for reuse and analysis

#### Analysis & Retraining
- Join `curator_evaluations` with `rec_results` on (query_id, media_id) to analyze fit scores vs. pipeline scores
- Track orchestrator planning accuracy and curator tier distribution
- Exposes rich signals for **offline analysis** and future **model/ranking retraining**

Over time, these feedback loops turn Reelix into a richer **discovery agent**, not just a static recommender: it can adapt its plans, retrieval parameters, and even suggestion style based on how you interact.

## Key API Endpoints

### Discovery Endpoints

#### 1) Agentic Discovery by Vibe (`/explore`)
Agent-powered conversational search with streaming SSE responses.

1) `POST /discovery/explore`
   - Orchestrator Agent parses natural language query and builds RecQuerySpec
   - Streams SSE events: `started` → `opening` → `recs` → `next_steps` → `done`
   - Opening summary is generated upfront for fast UI paint
   - Executes recommendation pipeline → curator agent in background
   - Returns final recommendations with why URL for explanations
   - Reflection Agent proposes a next-step suggestion for multi-turn discovery
   - Logs orchestrator decisions, curator evaluations, tier summaries, and reflection attempts

2) `GET /discovery/explore/why?query_id=...` (SSE)
   - Explanation Agent generates personalized "why" rationales
   - Streams JSONL events with `{media_id, why}` for each recommendation
   - Caches results in Supabase + Redis for reuse

3) `POST /discovery/explore/rerun`
   - Chip rerun endpoint: patches provider/year filters and reruns the same pipeline path
   - Bypasses orchestrator LLM, using last_spec from session state
   - Returns updated recommendations with new filters applied

#### 2) For-You Feed (`/for-you`)
Personalized feed based on user taste profile. 

1) `POST /discovery/for-you`
   - Queries the user's taste profile from the database
   - Runs the **for_you_feed** recipe (dense + BM25 + metadata + CE reranker) against the **user taste context** to fetch **Top-K** candidates
   - Builds the LLM prompt with those candidates and **persists it in the ticket store** (keyed by `query_id`)
   - Returns the candidate list with metadata (year, genres, posters, trailers, etc.) **plus** a `stream_url` for explanations
   - Logs a **query-intake record** and a **Top-K candidate snapshot** (IDs, ranks, and **per-signal score traces**)

2) `GET /discovery/for-you/why?query_id=...` (SSE)
   - Reads the LLM prompt and Top-K candidates from the ticket store
   - Performs LLM reasoning to generate concise "why you might enjoy it" copy
   - Streams events `{started, why_delta, done}` where `why_delta` includes `media_id`, optional `imdb_rating` and `rotten_tomatoes_rating`, and `why_you_might_enjoy_it` (markdown)

### User Profile & Preferences

#### 3) Taste Profile (`/taste_profile`)
Build and maintain a personalized **taste vector** from user interactions and preferences. Stores profile state in Supabase and powers the For-You feed and agent-based ranking.

1) `POST /taste_profile/rebuild`
   - Aggregates **user signals**: recent interactions (e.g., Love / Like / Not for me, trailer views), selected genres/vibes, and any provider filters
   - Fetches the corresponding **item embeddings** from Qdrant and computes a **taste vector** (weighted aggregation + normalization)
   - **Upserts** the profile into Supabase, recording metadata such as `vector_dim`, `n_signals_used`, `build_version`, and timestamps

2) `GET /taste_profile/me`
   - Returns the latest **profile metadata** and a safe subset of fields for inspection
   - Useful for gating UX ("has profile been built?") and for debugging profile freshness across sessions

#### 4) User Settings (`/users/me/settings`)
Manage user preferences for genres, keywords, and other personalization settings.

1) `PATCH /v2/users/me/settings/preferences`
   - Upsert user preferences (genres_include, keywords_include)
   - Updates stored in Supabase `user_preferences` table
   - Used during taste profile rebuilds and recommendation filtering

### User Data Management

#### 5) Watchlist (`/watchlist`)
Lets users save titles to watch later, mark them as watched, and optionally rate them (1–10). Designed to be idempotent and fast, with optimistic UI updates.

1) `POST /watchlist`
   - Adds or upserts an item in the user's watchlist (reactivates if previously soft-deleted)
   - Input fields like `title`, `poster_url`, etc. are denormalized hints to render immediately; canonical metadata lives in Qdrant/TMDB
   - Emits an interaction event (`watchlist_add`) for taste-signal logging

2) `GET /watchlist`
   - Lists the user's watchlist items, with optional filters/pagination
   - Hydrates metadata fields like genres, release_year, artworks, and why_summary, so the client avoids a second fetch

3) `PATCH /watchlist/{media_id}`
   - Atomically updates status and/or rating (ideal for "✓ Watched ▾ → quick-rate")
   - Emits an interaction event (`rating`) when a rating is present for taste-signal logging

4) `DELETE /watchlist/{media_id}`
   - Remove from watchlist
   - Soft delete the item. Sets `deleted_at`, `deleted_reason`, and derives `is_active=False`

#### 6) Interactions (`/interactions`)
Track user interactions with recommendations (Love, Like, Not for me, trailer views, etc.) for taste profile updates and analytics.

1) `POST /interactions`
   - Log user interaction events (e.g., `love`, `like`, `not_for_me`, `trailer_view`)
   - Stores interaction in Supabase with timestamp and metadata
   - Feeds into taste profile rebuilds and recommendation retraining
   - Used by smart rebuild controller to trigger controlled taste updates (max 1 rebuild per 2 minutes)

### Telemetry & Logging

#### 7) Telemetry (`/discovery/telemetry`)
Analytics and logging endpoints for tracking recommendation performance and caching explanations.

1) `POST /discovery/telemetry/final_recs`
   - Log final recommendations shown to user (fire-and-forget)
   - Caches LLM-generated "why" explanations in Redis for reuse
   - Skips caching for items where `why_source == "cache"` to avoid redundant writes
   - Writes to Supabase for offline analysis and A/B testing

**Tunable knobs** (with sensible defaults):

- Retrieval depths: `dense_depth`, `sparse_depth`
- Fusion: `rrf_k`
- Metadata weights: `{dense, sparse, rating, popularity, recency, genre}`
- Curator pass size: `top-k`
- Curator dimensions: `genre_fit`, `tone_fit`, `theme_fit`, `structure_fit`
- Tiering criteria: dynamic `final_recs` count from each tier

## Sample Query Flow

1. User enters a vibe-based prompt (e.g., _"Mind-bending sci-fi with existential themes on Netflix from the past 5 years"_)
2. Orchestrator Agent determines mode (CHAT vs RECS) and generates opening summary
3. Opening summary streams to UI immediately for fast feedback
4. RecQuerySpec is constructed with filters, genres, tone, themes
5. Recommendation Pipeline executes hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse + BM25)
6. Multi-stage ranking: metadata scorer + cross-encoder reranking
7. Curator Agent evaluates candidates in 2 parallel batches on genre/tone/theme/structure fit
8. Tier-based selection produces final recommendations
9. Reflection Agent analyzes the slate and streams a next-step suggestion (e.g., "Want to explore 70s paranoid sci-fi with that same vibe?")
10. Suggestion and strategy persisted to session memory — user can say "yes" to auto-advance into a new search
11. Explanation Agent streams personalized "why" rationales via SSE
12. UI displays cards with posters, ratings, metadata, rationale, and trailer links
13. All decisions logged to Supabase (orchestrator, curator, pipeline, explanations, reflection)
